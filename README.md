# LinSplit

A Rust reimplementation of [the Celeste AutoSplitter](https://github.com/ShootMe/LiveSplit.Celeste), for Linux.

## Usage

You can just install it using [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html), if you've got it installed : 
```
cargo install linsplit
```

If you don't have cargo installed, you can download binaries from the Releases tab (I might forgot to upload the binaries, open an issue if one is missing !)
If/when the projet gets big enough, I might try to upload it to various package managers. 

## Bug reporting / Suggestions

Open an issue ! I'll try to read it as soon as possible. If you're reporting an issue, please provide instructions to recreate it.

## Contributing

My Rust isn't very good, I'm almost no longer a beginner but I don't feel really confident. If you have Rust experience and want to help with the structure or anything else, feel free to open an issue or a pull request ! I just have one go-to rule : no AI-generated code.

## Credits

Credits are due to the developers of [LiveSplit.Celeste](https://github.com/ShootMe/LiveSplit.Celeste) from which I took most of the logic used in this program. I also want to thank the developers of [LiveSplit](https://github.com/LiveSplit/livesplit) (and [livesplit-core](https://github.com/LiveSplit/livesplit-core)), as I took a bit of code (the API part) from livesplit-core and because LiveSplit is an amazing software.
